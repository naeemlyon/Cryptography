# Cryptography
C/C++ code for Encryptosystem

1. GCD (a,b)
User input two numbers a & b and the system returns there
Greatest Common Divisor otherwise mentions if they are co
prime.

2. Inverse (n,m) / Extended Euclidean Algorithm
User input two numbers n & m, where n is the number
whose inverse is to be calculated and m is the modulus.
System should return calculated inverse or update user if no
inverse exists.

3. Miller Rabin Test (p)
User should enter p as input to see whether p is a prime
number or a composite number? System should test p for at
least 10 different a’s and then return “Number is Prime” or
“Number is not prime” for the given input.

4. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

5. Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir (RSA) cryptosystem
( via Miller-Rabin- Test + EEU). pseude-code from Wikipedia
with same Variable Name

6. Mathematical operation on infinitely Extra Large Number
